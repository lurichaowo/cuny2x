These are links to 3 projects I have worked on mostly completed from High School until now.

##### This Garden Defender Game was the first project I had finished in my Game Programming class during my last year in High School. The concept of the project was to allow us to familiarize ourselves with the Unity3D interface, the concept of objects, and collision detection.

##### This 3D Maze Runner Game was another project I had completed along with my partner, Deryke, this assignment was talored towards the halloween theme. The basic concept of this game was essentially a scavenger hunt in which you had to navigate yourself in a randomly generated maze and locate 6 of the children the witch kidnapped.

##### This last one was my final project during the fall semester of my Freshman year. I had worked on this project with my partner, Lehman. We had this scrabble game in mind as it applied the knowledge of arrays, imports of external libraries, function calling, and dictionaries. However, we did not incorporate the limitations of domino like placement of the tiles nor the 50 point bonus at the end of the game.
