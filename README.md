These are links to 3 projects I have worked on mostly completed from High School until now.

##### This is an Image Gallery is created using html and css that I have created with the help of a Udemy Web Development tutorial. It uses bootstrap to display a navbar that also has a hamburger style dropdown menu. The image gallery takes advantage of the bootstrap grid system to allow for dynamic rearranging to the browser size.

##### This 3D Maze Runner Game was another project I had completed along with my partner, Deryke, this assignment was talored towards the halloween theme. The basic concept of this game was essentially a scavenger hunt in which you had to navigate yourself in a randomly generated maze and locate 6 of the children the witch kidnapped.

##### The last project is a side project I did using Angular 7 by following a tic-tac-toe tutorial. I updated the imports to match Angular 7 since the tutorial was made for Angular 2. I also implemented my own version of the check and AI. I am also currently working on some more front end elements to make the webpage visually better.
